<p>When we look at Obito's right-eye Mangekyou Sharingan,
it seems like he has two different abilities. 
One is intagibilty, and the other is the dimension warp thing. 
However, people claim that these are the same ability working in different ways.
Both are just space-time manipulation at a close range. 
This should be correct since Mangekyou Sharingans are supposed to have one ability in each eye, 
but I'm not too sure.</p>
